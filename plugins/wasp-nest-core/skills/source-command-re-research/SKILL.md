# source-command-re-research

Use this skill when the user asks to run the migrated source command `re-research`.

Read [the command procedure](../../commands/re-research.md) in full before acting. Resolve paths in that procedure relative to its `commands/` directory. Codex invokes this as a skill, not a slash command.

This command maintains The Wasp Nest itself. Require a writable source checkout and read its live `src/commands/re-research.md` before making changes; never edit the installed plugin cache.
