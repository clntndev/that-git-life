# source-command-ship-gate

Use this skill when the user asks to run the migrated source command `ship-gate`.

Read [the command procedure](../../commands/ship-gate.md) in full before acting. Resolve paths in that procedure relative to its `commands/` directory. Codex invokes this as a skill, not a slash command.
